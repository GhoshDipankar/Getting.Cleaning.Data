# Getting.Cleaning.Data
### Project Assignment for Getting and Cleaning Data  
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Datasets are prepared through experiments with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years.  
Each person performed six activities wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on their waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, different measurements were captured for each activity for each person.
The obtained datasets have been randomly partitioned into two sets where 70% of the volunteers were selected for generating the training data and 30% for the test data.

## The depository contains following files:  
### 1. CodeBook.md  
The Code Book overviews the data sets used in this project and serves as a guidance for the user, the process through which a tidy data set can be obtained from the given raw data sets.  

### 2. run_analysis.R  
A R Script which can be used to do the following:  
a) To download and unzip the given data files in zip format and then unzip  
b) To merge the training and the test sets to create one data set  
c) To extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement  
d) To label the data set appropriately with descriptive variable names  
e) To use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set  
f) To create a second, independent tidy data set with the mean of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### 3. tidyData.txt  
A tidy data set generated by run_analysis.R
